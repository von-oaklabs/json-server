      "lead": "Drawing on evidence involving about 25 million population worldwide, an international research team demonstrates that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 significantly increases the risk of asthma, affecting both children and adults.",
      "body": "<p>Asthma is currently an incurable disease that severely impairs qualityof life, with recurring symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, andshortness of breath. As of today, about 4 percent of the world'spopulation suffers from asthma, with more than 30 million new casesarising annually. Evidence suggests that long-term exposure to airpollution of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important risk factorfor developing asthma. However, inconsistencies in findings from earlierepidemiological studies have left this potential health risk open todebate, as some studies observed an increased risk while others found noassociation.</p><p>To resolve this controversy, Dr. Ruijing Ni, the first author of thestudy published today in the journal One Earth, and her colleagues atthe Max Planck Institute for Chemistry have conducted a comprehensiveglobal meta-analysis with researchers from China, the USA, andAustralia. The research team determined the data from 68 epidemiologicstudies from 2019 conducted across 22 countries, including those inNorth America, Western Europe, East Asia, South Asia, and Africa. Theyconclude that there is now sufficient evidence with high confidencelevel to support an association between long-term exposure to ambientPM2.5 and asthma.</p><h3>11 percent of new cases of asthma in Germany are attributable toparticulate matter</h3><p>\"We estimate that globally in 2019, almost a third of asthma cases areattributable to long-term PM2.5 exposure, corresponding to 63.5 millionexisting cases and 11.4 million new cases. In Germany, the pollution mayhave been responsible for 11 percent of new asthma cases, whichcorresponds to 28,000 people. We also find that the risk of asthmaassociated with PM2.5 is much higher in children than in adults,reflecting the age-related vulnerability,\" says Dr. Ni.</p><p>Typically, the full maturation of lung and immune function is graduallycompleted until early adulthood. As a result, children may be moresusceptible to air pollution exposure, which can lead to airwayoxidative stress, inflammation, and hyper-responsiveness, as well aschanges in immunological responses and respiratory sensitization toallergens. All these factors play a role in the development of asthma.</p><p>Further using these data, the research team establishedexposure-response curves for both childhood and adult asthma. Suchcurves are widely employed to quantitatively assess health risks byillustrating the relationship between the level of exposure to aparticular substance, e.g., PM2.5 and the magnitude of the effect itproduces, e.g., asthma risk. The exposure-response curves weredetermined by incorporating evidence from countries and regions acrossvarious income levels, which capture the global variation in PM2.5exposure. \"This initiative is important for quantifying global healtheffects of air pollution,\" comments Prof. Yuming Guo, an epidemiologistfrom Monash University.</p><h3>Countries with different income levels and particulate matter pollutionconsidered</h3><p>Populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are typicallyexposed to higher concentrations of air pollution and bear a greaterburden of PM2.5. In contrast, research on the health effects of PM2.5has been limited in these regions previously, with the majority ofstudies conducted in North America and Western Europe. Consequently,attempting a global health impact assessment of PM2.5 exposurenecessitates extrapolating exposure-response associations observed inhigh-income countries to LMICs. The approach may introduce largeuncertainty due to the differences in air pollution sources, healthcaresystems, and demographic characteristics between high-income countriesand LMICs.</p><p>The inclusion of evidence from several LMICs mitigates the limitation inapproach and enables the exposure-response curves to be applicable toassess city- to global-scale attributable burden of asthma, as well asasthma health benefits associated with air pollution reductions, e.g.,health benefits obtained from policy-driven reductions in air pollutionunder different scenarios.</p><p>\"Our findings highlight the urgent need for policymakers to enforcestringent legislation to continuously combat air pollution, whilepersonal protective measures, such as wearing masks, can also helpreduce individual exposure and mitigate the risk of asthma,\" emphasizesProf. Yafang Cheng, the corresponding author of the study and thedirector at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.</p><p>The study was conducted by researchers from Max Planck Institute forChemistry (Germany), Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the ChineseAcademy of Sciences (China), University of Washington (USA), and MonashUniversity (Australia).</p>"

      "lead": "Heart disease is a leading cause of death. You can't change some risk factors for it, such as family history, sex at birth or age. But you can take plenty of other steps to lower your risk of heart disease.",
      "body": "<p>Get started with these eight tips to boost your heart health:</p><ol><li><h3>Don't smoke or use tobacco</h3><p>One of the best things you can do for your heart is to stop smokingor using smokeless tobacco. Even if you're not a smoker, be sure tostay away from secondhand smoke.</p><p>Chemicals in tobacco can damage the heart and blood vessels.Cigarette smoke lowers the oxygen in the blood, which raises bloodpressure and heart rate. That's because the heart has to work harderto supply enough oxygen to the body and brain.</p><p>There's good news though. The risk of heart disease starts to dropin as little as a day after quitting. After a year withoutcigarettes, the risk of heart disease drops to about half that of asmoker. No matter how long or how much you smoked, you'll startreaping rewards as soon as you quit.</p></li><li><h3>Get moving: Aim for at least 30 to 60 minutes of activity daily</h3><p>Regular, daily physical activity can lower the risk of heartdisease. Physical activity helps control your weight. It also lowersthe chances of getting other conditions that may put a strain on theheart. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol and type2 diabetes.</p><p>If you haven't been active for a while, you may need to slowly workyour way up to these goals. But in general, you should aim for atleast:</p><ul><li>150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic exercise, such as walkingat a brisk pace.</li><li>75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity, such as running.</li><li>Two or more strength training sessions a week.</li></ul><p>Even shorter bouts of activity offer heart benefits. So if you can'tmeet those guidelines, don't give up. Just five minutes of movingcan help. Activities such as gardening, housekeeping, taking thestairs and walking the dog all count toward your total. You don'thave to exercise hard to benefit. But you can see bigger benefits ifyou boost the intensity, length and frequency of your workouts.</p></li><li><h3>Eat a heart-healthy diet</h3><p>A healthy diet can help protect the heart, improve blood pressureand cholesterol, and lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. Aheart-healthy eating plan includes:</p><ul><li>Vegetables and fruits.</li><li>Beans or other legumes.</li><li>Lean meats and fish.</li><li>Low-fat or fat-free dairy foods.</li><li>Whole grains.</li><li>Healthy fats such as olive oil and avocado.</li></ul><p>Two examples of heart-healthy food plans include the DietaryApproaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and theMediterranean diet.</p><p>Take in less of the following:</p><ul><li>Salt or high-sodium meals.</li><li>Sugar or sweetened beverages.</li><li>Highly refined carbohydrates.</li><li>Alcohol.</li><li>Highly processed food, such as processed meats.</li><li>Saturated fat, which is found in red meat, full-fat dairyproducts, palm oil and coconut oil.</li><li>Trans fat, which is found in some fried fast food, chips and bakedgoods.</li></ul></li><li><h3>Maintain a healthy weight</h3><p>Being overweight — especially around the middle of the body — raisesthe risk of heart disease. Extra weight can lead to conditions thatraise the chances of getting heart disease. These conditions includehigh blood pressure, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The body mass index (BMI) uses height and weight to find out whethera person is overweight or obese. A BMI of 25 or higher is consideredoverweight. In general, it's linked with higher cholesterol, higherblood pressure, and an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.</p><p>Waist circumference also can be a useful tool to measure how muchbelly fat you have. The risk of heart disease is higher if the waistmeasurement is greater than:</p><ul><li>40 inches (101.6 centimeters, or cm) for men.</li><li>35 inches (88.9 cm) for women.</li></ul><p>Even a small weight loss can be good for you. Reducing weight byjust 3% to 5% can help lower certain fats in the blood calledtriglycerides. It can lower blood sugar, also called glucose. And itcan cut the risk of type 2 diabetes. Losing even more helps lowerblood pressure and blood cholesterol levels.</p></li><li><h3>Get quality sleep</h3><p>People who don't get enough sleep have a higher risk of obesity,high blood pressure, heart attack, diabetes and depression.</p><p>Most adults need at least seven hours of sleep each night. Childrenusually need more. So make sure you get enough rest. Set a sleepschedule and stick to it. To do that, go to bed and wake up at thesame times each day. Keep your bedroom dark and quiet too, so it'seasier to sleep.</p><p>Talk to a member of your health care team if you feel like you getenough sleep but you're still tired throughout the day. Ask if youneed to be evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea. It's a conditionthat can raise your risk of heart disease. Symptoms of obstructivesleep apnea include loud snoring, stopping breathing for short timesduring sleep and waking up gasping for air. Treatment forobstructive sleep apnea may involve losing weight if you'reoverweight. It also might involve using a device that keeps yourairway open while you sleep. This is called a continuous positiveairway pressure (CPAP) device.</p></li><li><h3>Manage stress</h3><p>Ongoing stress can play a role in higher blood pressure and otherrisk factors for heart disease. Some people also cope with stress inunhealthy ways. For example, they may overeat, drink or smoke. Youcan boost your health by finding other ways to manage stress.Healthy tactics include physical activity, relaxation exercises,mindfulness, yoga and meditation.</p><p>If stress becomes overwhelming, get a health care checkup. Ongoingstress may be linked with mental health conditions such as anxietyand depression. These conditions also are tied to heart disease riskfactors, including higher blood pressure and less blow flow to theheart. If you think you might have depression or anxiety, it'simportant to get treatment.</p></li><li><h3>Get regular health screening tests</h3><p>High blood pressure and high cholesterol can damage the heart andblood vessels. But if you don't get checked for these conditions,you likely won't know whether you have them. Regular screening testscan tell you what your numbers are and whether you need to takeaction.</p><ul><li><p><span>Blood pressure.</span> Regular bloodpressure screenings usually start in childhood. Starting at age18, blood pressure should be measured at least once every twoyears. This checks for high blood pressure as a risk factor forheart disease and stroke.</p></li><li><p><span>Cholesterol levels.</span>TheNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommendsthat cholesterol screenings start between the ages of 9 and 11.Earlier testing may be recommended if you have other riskfactors, such as a family history of early-onset heart disease.After the first cholesterol test, screenings should be repeatedevery five years. Then the timing changes with age. The NHLBIrecommends that women ages 55 to 65 and men ages 45 to 65 getscreened every 1 to 2 years. People over 65 should get theircholesterol tested once a year.</p></li><li><p><span>Type 2 diabetes screening.</span>Diabetes involves ongoing high blood sugar levels. It raises thechances of getting heart disease. Risk factors for diabetesinclude being overweight and having a family history ofdiabetes. If you have any of the risk factors, your health careteam may recommend early screening. If not, screening isrecommended starting at age 45. Then you get your blood sugarlevels tested again every three years.</p></li></ul><p>If you have a condition such as high cholesterol, high bloodpressure or diabetes, talk with your health care team. Your doctormay prescribe medicines and recommend lifestyle changes. Make sureto take your medicines exactly as prescribed, and follow ahealthy-lifestyle plan.</p></li><li><h3>Take steps to prevent infections</h3><p>Certain infections may lead to heart problems. For instance, gumdisease may be a risk factor for heart and blood vessel diseases. Sobrush and floss daily. Get regular dental checkups too.</p><p>Other illnesses caused by infections can make existing heartproblems worse. Vaccines help protect against infectious diseases.So stay up to date on the following shots:</p><ul><li>Yearly flu vaccine.</li><li>COVID-19 vaccine, which lowers the chances of getting very sick.</li><li>Pneumococcal vaccine, which reduces the risk of certain illnessescaused by bacteria.</li><li>Tdap vaccine, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria andpertussis.</li></ul><p>Ask your health care professional if you need any other vaccinestoo.</p></li></ol>"
