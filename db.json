      "body": "<p>Asthma is currently an incurable disease that severely impairs qualityof life, with recurring symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, andshortness of breath. As of today, about 4 percent of the world'spopulation suffers from asthma, with more than 30 million new casesarising annually. Evidence suggests that long-term exposure to airpollution of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important risk factorfor developing asthma. However, inconsistencies in findings from earlierepidemiological studies have left this potential health risk open todebate, as some studies observed an increased risk while others found noassociation.</p><p>To resolve this controversy, Dr. Ruijing Ni, the first author of thestudy published today in the journal One Earth, and her colleagues atthe Max Planck Institute for Chemistry have conducted a comprehensiveglobal meta-analysis with researchers from China, the USA, andAustralia. The research team determined the data from 68 epidemiologicstudies from 2019 conducted across 22 countries, including those inNorth America, Western Europe, East Asia, South Asia, and Africa. Theyconclude that there is now sufficient evidence with high confidencelevel to support an association between long-term exposure to ambientPM2.5 and asthma.</p><h3>11 percent of new cases of asthma in Germany are attributable toparticulate matter</h3><p>\"We estimate that globally in 2019, almost a third of asthma cases areattributable to long-term PM2.5 exposure, corresponding to 63.5 millionexisting cases and 11.4 million new cases. In Germany, the pollution mayhave been responsible for 11 percent of new asthma cases, whichcorresponds to 28,000 people. We also find that the risk of asthmaassociated with PM2.5 is much higher in children than in adults,reflecting the age-related vulnerability,\" says Dr. Ni.</p><p>Typically, the full maturation of lung and immune function is graduallycompleted until early adulthood. As a result, children may be moresusceptible to air pollution exposure, which can lead to airwayoxidative stress, inflammation, and hyper-responsiveness, as well aschanges in immunological responses and respiratory sensitization toallergens. All these factors play a role in the development of asthma.</p><p>Further using these data, the research team establishedexposure-response curves for both childhood and adult asthma. Suchcurves are widely employed to quantitatively assess health risks byillustrating the relationship between the level of exposure to aparticular substance, e.g., PM2.5 and the magnitude of the effect itproduces, e.g., asthma risk. The exposure-response curves weredetermined by incorporating evidence from countries and regions acrossvarious income levels, which capture the global variation in PM2.5exposure. \"This initiative is important for quantifying global healtheffects of air pollution,\" comments Prof. Yuming Guo, an epidemiologistfrom Monash University.</p><h3>Countries with different income levels and particulate matter pollutionconsidered</h3><p>Populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are typicallyexposed to higher concentrations of air pollution and bear a greaterburden of PM2.5. In contrast, research on the health effects of PM2.5has been limited in these regions previously, with the majority ofstudies conducted in North America and Western Europe. Consequently,attempting a global health impact assessment of PM2.5 exposurenecessitates extrapolating exposure-response associations observed inhigh-income countries to LMICs. The approach may introduce largeuncertainty due to the differences in air pollution sources, healthcaresystems, and demographic characteristics between high-income countriesand LMICs.</p><p>The inclusion of evidence from several LMICs mitigates the limitation inapproach and enables the exposure-response curves to be applicable toassess city- to global-scale attributable burden of asthma, as well asasthma health benefits associated with air pollution reductions, e.g.,health benefits obtained from policy-driven reductions in air pollutionunder different scenarios.</p><p>\"Our findings highlight the urgent need for policymakers to enforcestringent legislation to continuously combat air pollution, whilepersonal protective measures, such as wearing masks, can also helpreduce individual exposure and mitigate the risk of asthma,\" emphasizesProf. Yafang Cheng, the corresponding author of the study and thedirector at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.</p><p>The study was conducted by researchers from Max Planck Institute forChemistry (Germany), Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the ChineseAcademy of Sciences (China), University of Washington (USA), and MonashUniversity (Australia).</p>"
